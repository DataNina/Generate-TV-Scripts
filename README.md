# Generate-TV-Scripts

### Hint
This project was completed as part of Udacity's nanodegree program "Deep Learning"

### Goal
This project aims at generateing an own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs based on the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The dveloped neural network  will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

### Instructions
- Get the Data

- Explore the Data

- Implement Preprocessing Functions:

- Lookup Table
- Tokenize Punctuation
- Pre-process all the data and save it
- Build the Neural Network

- Check Access to GPU
- Input Batching
- test the Dataloader
- Model
- Defining Forward and Backpropagation
- Neural Network Training

- Train Loop
- Hyperparameters
- Training
- Generate TV Script

- Generate Text
Generate a New Script
(Optionally) Accelerating the Training Process
If your code is taking too long to run, you will need to either reduce the complexity of your chosen RNN architecture or switch to running your code on a GPU. If you'd like to use a GPU, you can spin up an instance of your own:

Amazon Web Services
You can use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance.
